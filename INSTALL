Building and installing twin

For the impatient, it basically reduces to
  ./configure
  make
  
then run as root
  make install
  
on Linux, also remember to run as root:
  ldconfig

on FreeBSD instead, remember to run as root:
  ldconfig -R

To compile twin you need the following programs installed
on your system:
	
  * a Bourne-shell or compatible (for example bash, dash, ash...)
  
  * make (most variants are supported: GNU make, BSD make...)

  * an ANSI C compiler (for example gcc or clang)


For detailed instructions about compiling and installing twin, see the file `Tutorial',
sections 3 and 4, distributed with twin in the docs/ subdirectory.

In summary, it is STRONGLY recommended to install at least the following packages before compiling twin
(the exact names depend on the operating system or Linux distribution):

  * x11-dev      - may be named x11-devel, libx11-dev ...
  * xpm-dev      - may be named xpm-devel, libxpm-dev ...
  * ncurses-dev  - may be named ncurses-devel, libncurses-dev ...
  * zlib-dev     - may be named zlib1g-dev, zlib-devel, libzlib-dev ...

On Linux, it is STRONGLY recommended to also install the following package before compiling twin:

  * gpm-dev      - may be named gpm-devel, libgpm-dev ...

For a discussion about MANUALLY configuring twin (almost never necessary),
see the help file `Configure', again in the docs/ subdirectory.
-- WARNING: if you manually enable options that were disabled by `./configure',
build will almost certainly fail! --
